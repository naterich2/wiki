# Welcome to my Wiki!

Hi, I'm Nate!  I have a Masters Degree in Biomedical Engineering and particularly like Systems Biology and Bioinformatics.  I also love working with computers and have been working on making a home server for the last few years.  This wiki is my aim to have a place to store information both for myself and others on the projects I've done related to school and my own projects!

This wiki is actively under development as I do more and more stuff I will try to update this as much as I can!

## nrichman.lan
My intranet has a lot of services on it, some I need, some are just for fun.  Check out the home page for how I set this up, and what these services are for more info!

## Utilities
The utilities page is just a collection of tools I've developed both for school (tools for homework, short scripts for grading, etc.) and for my home projects.

## Projects
The projects page is a section for larger scale projects I've undertaken, mostly for school, but some for my home projects.
